body_paragraph: "The Walk to the Sea crosses a terain that, centuries before, was not land at
                 all, but an active port.  Beginning at the State House on Beacon Hill, overlooking the
            old Boston Common, the Walk passes historic monuments and skyscrapers. The history of Boston is linked to the sea,
                 whose smells and sounds once invaded the city.  The walk from Beacon Hill to Long Wharf, which stretches for a mile and descends a hundred
                 feet, gives life to that story."
