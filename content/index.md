body_paragraph: "The Walk crosses a terain that, centuries before, was not land at
                 all, but an active port.  The history of Boston is linked to the Sea,
                 whose smells and sounds once invaded the city.  The walk from the
                 top to the sea, which stretches for a mile and descends a hundred
                 feet, gives life to that story."
