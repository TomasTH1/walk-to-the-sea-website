# The Financial District's Rebirth: The Great Fire of 1872 

Boston's Financial District has had to make many transitions as the financial landscape of the United States has changed. Today's Financial District used to be the waterfront, and with good reason. For many years, Boston's business sector was dominated by trade and other businesses that relied on the port. However, as the importance of trade to the Boston economy lessened, businesses like banks and insurance began to build skyscrapers and set up shop in the area. 

In the late 19th Century, the existing Financial District was forever changed, when it was essentially destroyed in a devastating fire. 

## The Fire
While Boston underwent many gradual changes in the 19th Century, the Great Fire of 1872 created devastating destruction that would change the city, and especially the Financial District, forever. 

The fire began on November 9, in the basement of a warehouse on Summer Street. It spread so quickly and had such heat that it burned all wood buildings, and [even melted some metal buildings](https://www.boston.gov/news/notes-archives-great-fire-1872) in the area, totally 65 acres of damaged space. The image below shows a 1872 drawing of the damaged area.

The fire set records for the amount of monetary damages it caused, but for a fire this large and hot, relatively few lives were lost, compared to a year earlier in Chicago, when a fire caused over 300 deaths. Counts differ on how many died in the fire, but estimates are from [11-18, with about a quarter being firefighters.](https://www.boston.gov/news/notes-archives-great-fire-1872)

## History and the Fire
The history contained in the Financial District also played a part in the firefighting process. While many buildings were lost in the fire, the fire stopped around the intersection of Washington and Milk Streets. This is important because much of the effort of the firefighters was devoted around this intersection, because of the proximity of the Old South Meeting House.  Saving the Meeting House was a priority of firefighters, [because of its historical significance.](https://bostonfirehistory.org/fires/great-boston-fire-of-1872/) The importance of Revolutionary history to Boston has existed since the late 19th Century, and its preservation of these buildings through a devastating fire is exemplary of that.

While the Old South Meeting House was saved, other historical landmarks were lost. One such landmark was the original Trinity Church. Trinity Church [was consecrated in 1735](https://www.flickr.com/photos/boston_public_library/5415409201/in/album-72157625849286255/) on Summer Street in the Financial District. It was lost in the fire, with a shell of the building remaining in the wake, as seen in the image below. The congregation was then moved to Trinity Church that still stands in Copley Square. Also lost in the fire were [two local newspapers headquarters, as well as seven banks.](https://www.telegram.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2019/03/21/al-southwick-boston-fires-2019-and-1872/5659840007/) While the historic Old South Meeting House was saved, many historic buildings were not. Today, at the previous site of the Church at Hawley and Summer Streets is retail shops, and a block from the Downtown Crossing T stop.

## Rebuilding and Effects 
An important reason why the fire was not as deadly as other large fires in urban centers was that there were very few residential buildings affected. Since the influx of businesses to Downtown Boston in the early 19th Century, most of the damage was done to warehouses and office buildings. The city of Boston began to plan once again for a district where many would work, with a commercial focus.

As Boston sought to rebuild the gutted Financial District, they faced challenges. With devastating property damage, the neighborhood faced an uphill battle. However, the rebuilding efforts are illustrative of Boston's resilience, especially within the business and economic center.  The scale of damage allowed for an overhaul of the neighborhood. A committee of Bostonians formed to urge the city to make changes that would make streets wider and straighter, and therefore make the streets safer and fire harder to spread among buildings.
