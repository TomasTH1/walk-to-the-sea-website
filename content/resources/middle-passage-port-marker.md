title: "Middle Passage Port Marker"
description: "The Boston Middle Passage Marker looks two ways: Out to Boston Harbor, where enslaved Africans and enslaved Indigenous people arrived and departed, and also inward, down State Street, where these enslaved people and their descendants lived, worked, and fought for freedom. The Port Marker was designed to echo the Walk to the Sea and serves as a final stop on your walking tour."
