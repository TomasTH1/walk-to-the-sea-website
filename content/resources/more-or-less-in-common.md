title: "More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape"
description: "What kinds of images come to mind when you think about the environment?
              Trees, water, green landscapes, and scenic vistas? But what about people—communities,
              housing, roads, neighborhoods, cities, schools, and factories? These are all a part of
              the environment too. And environmental issues can’t be set apart in a distinct category
              from social questions. Humans and the natural world are deeply connected, through the
              past, present, and future."
