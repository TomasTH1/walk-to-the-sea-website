        The Walk crosses a terain that, centuries before, was not land at
        all, but an active port.  The history of Boston is linked to the Sea,
        whose smells and sounds once invaded the city.  The walk from the
        top to the sea, which stretches for a mile and descends a hundred
        feet, gives life to that story.
